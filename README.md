# SSD1306 library for ESP-32

An alternative library for SSD1306 displays developed with performance in mind.

This code is heavily under development, so use it at your own risk.

If you prefer something stable then I'd recommend [this excellent library](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-ssd1306) maintained by [nopnop2002](https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-ssd1306).
